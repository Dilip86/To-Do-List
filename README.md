## Features

## How it Works
The application uses HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. Here's a brief overview of the main files and their functions:

`index.html`: Contains the structure of the web page, including the task list, input field, and buttons.

`style.css`: Defines the styles and layout for the web page, including the appearance of tasks and buttons.

`script.js`: Implements the core functionality of the To-Do List app, including adding, marking, and deleting tasks. It also handles local storage to save and load tasks.
