This is a simple To-Do List web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. The tasks are stored locally in the browser's storage.

## Demo

You can see a live demo of this To-Do List app [here](#).

## Features

- Add new tasks to the list.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Delete tasks.
- Local storage support to save tasks across sessions.

## How it Works
The application uses HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. Here's a brief overview of the main files and their functions:

### index.html:
Contains the structure of the web page, including the task list, input field, and buttons.

### style.css: 
Defines the styles and layout for the web page, including the appearance of tasks and buttons.

### script.js: 
Implements the core functionality of the To-Do List app, including adding, marking, and deleting tasks. It also handles local storage to save and load tasks.
